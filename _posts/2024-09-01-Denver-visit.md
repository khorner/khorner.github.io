There's something magical about reconnecting with long-time family friends, especially in a place as beautiful as Colorado. Recently, I had the chance to visit some dear friends just outside Denver, and the trip was filled with unforgettable moments. From breathtaking hikes to experiencing live music at a bucket-list venue, our adventure had it all. Here's a glimpse of our journey!

### Hiking the Garden of the Gods & Exploring Castlewood Canyon

Our adventure began with a hike at the stunning [Garden of the Gods](https://www.gardenofgods.com/), a National Natural Landmark located in Colorado Springs. The towering red rock formations set against the backdrop of the snow-capped Pikes Peak were awe-inspiring. We spent the morning winding through the various trails, each turn revealing a new, breathtaking view.

After the breathtaking views at Garden of the Gods, we took a day trip to [Castlewood Canyon State Park](https://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/Parks/CastlewoodCanyon). This hidden gem, located just outside of Denver, offered a unique mix of rugged beauty and tranquility. The hike through the canyon revealed dramatic cliffs, lush vegetation, and the remnants of the historic Castlewood Dam, which burst in 1933, creating an essential piece of Colorado’s history. We enjoyed exploring the winding trails, crossing small creeks, and soaking up the serene atmosphere of the canyon.

### A Night at Red Rocks: Gregory Alan Isakov Concert

The highlight of our trip was attending our fifth Gregory Alan Isakov concert at the legendary [Red Rocks Amphitheatre](https://www.redrocksonline.com/). Seeing a concert at Red Rocks had been on my bucket list for years, and it did not disappoint. The acoustics of the natural rock formations and the view of the city lights below made for an unforgettable experience. Gregory Alan Isakov's soulful melodies resonated perfectly in the unique setting, and we couldn't have asked for a better night.

### Hiking Meyer Ranch

Our final adventure took us to [Meyer Ranch Park](https://www.jeffco.us/1431/Meyer-Ranch-Park), a serene spot tucked away in the foothills of the Rockies. The park offered a peaceful contrast to the vibrant energy of Red Rocks, with its quiet trails winding through dense pine forests and wildflower meadows. We enjoyed a leisurely hike, soaking in the crisp mountain air and the tranquil beauty of our surroundings.

### Reflecting on an Incredible Trip

Looking back, this trip was the perfect blend of adventure, music, and friendship. Colorado's natural beauty, paired with meaningful time spent with loved ones, made it an experience to cherish. I’m already looking forward to the next opportunity to return and explore even more of what this incredible state has to offer.

If you ever get the chance to visit Colorado, I highly recommend adding these spots to your list. Whether you're hiking through the red rocks of Garden of the Gods, experiencing a live concert at Red Rocks, or taking in the tranquility of Meyer Ranch, you're in for a memorable adventure.

Until next time, Colorado!
