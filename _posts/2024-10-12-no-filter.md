    KH: I asked the Big3 a question. After their response, I asked it:

> format this conversation as a blog post using Jekyll markdown. 

``` 
KH: My expectation was the post should have my question and the LLM's response.
 - Gemini - "a perceptive observation."; **what I asked for**
 - Claude - "an insightful observation."; essay without original response
 - ChatGPT - "a sharp observation!"; another essay without original response
```

In an effort to explore how different AI language models interpret and respond to philosophical observations about human behavior, I posed the following question to three prominent LLMs: Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini:

> Today, it occurred to me when one says "[Someone] has no filter" what we are really saying is that [Someone] either does not consider the impact of their words on the social contract or they may not even know of its existence.

This prompt touches on concepts of social awareness, communication, and implicit societal norms. I was curious to see how each AI would approach this observation and what insights they might offer.  

You can read the full responses from each AI at the following links:

- [Claude's Response]({% post_url 2024-10-12-no-filter-claude %})
- [ChatGPT's Response]({% post_url 2024-10-12-no-filter-chatgpt %})
- [Gemini's Response]({% post_url 2024-10-12-no-filter-gemini %})

Each AI brought its own unique perspective to the question, highlighting different aspects of the concept and offering varied interpretations. Some common themes emerged across the responses, such as the importance of social awareness and the complexity of human communication.

However, there were also interesting differences in how each AI approached the topic. [You might want to add a brief summary of key differences here, once you have the actual responses.]

This experiment showcases the diverse ways in which AI language models can engage with abstract concepts and philosophical observations. It also demonstrates the potential for using AI as a tool for exploring ideas from multiple angles.

I encourage you to read each response and consider how they compare to your own thoughts on the subject. How do you think these AI interpretations align with human understanding of social filters and communication norms?

Feel free to share your thoughts and observations in the comments below. This conversation opens up fascinating avenues for discussing not only human behavior but also the capabilities and limitations of AI in interpreting nuanced social concepts.
