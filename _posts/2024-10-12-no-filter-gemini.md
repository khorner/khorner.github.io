Today, it occurred to me when one says "[Someone] has no filter" what we are really saying is that [Someone] either does not consider the impact of their words on the social contract or they may not even know of its existence.

**That's a perceptive observation.**

When someone is described as having "no filter," we often imply that they speak their mind without considering the social norms or expectations that guide our interactions. This suggests a lack of understanding or awareness of the unspoken rules and boundaries that govern our relationships. 

It's like they're operating on a different wavelength, one that doesn't account for the potential consequences of their words on others. This can lead to misunderstandings, hurt feelings, or even conflict.
