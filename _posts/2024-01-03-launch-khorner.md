`www.khorner.com` is rebranded and now LIVE! 

Previously, this site was a personal lifestyle Wordpress site. As I began reinvesting in my technical skills, 
I used it to workshop my understanding on AWS services like Route53, Amplify, S3, etc. 

When I decided it was time to create a portfolio of work, I needed to rebrand. 

This site is intended to document my Generative AI journey and showcase my progress and technical competencies. The site
is hosted on Github Pages. I've configured my domain to land on it and have a [local environment](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) to maintain it.

I chose Github Pages for multiple reasons:
1. It's free
1. I can update and manage it in my IDE - Visual Studio Code
1. It's free
1. It's a simple example of a DevOps pipeline: I commit changes via git and it publishes the site
1. I learned enough Ruby, Gems, and Markdown to be dangerous! ðŸ’£ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥
1. You can see the code at [khorner.github.io](https://github.com/khorner/khorner.github.io)

## Pre-launch Task List:

- [x] Revert domain record managment (SOA, NS, MX, CNAME TXT) to Google Domains from AWS Route53 
- [x] Verify khorner.com domain with Github account
- [x] Create Github repository: khorner.github.io
- [x] Install and configure local Ruby, Gem Jekyll environment
- [x] Configure Visual Studio Code environment for Github and install Markdown Preview Enhanced extension
- [x] Read the Markdown guide
- [ ] Stay awesome!
