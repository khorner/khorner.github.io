The clock starts NOW...
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has granted Off-Zero Financial, LLC. registration according to Section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940!

## What does this mean?
I have 120 days to implement an interactive website that provides investment advice according to this [this exemption](https://www.sec.gov/rules/2002/12/exemption-certain-investment-advisers-operating-through-internet)

## Plan updates
To bring [The Plan](/plan.md) into reality, I've broken it up into 3 parts: 
1. Off-Zero Financial, LLC.
1. offzero.io
1. MyFi.Coach

### Off-Zero Financial, LLC. 
The legal entity to be registered as an Investment Advisor with the SEC under the Internet Investment Advisor exemption. This allows it to provide fiduciary investment advice via an interactive website.

### MyFi.Coach
The interactive website Off-Zero Financial, LLC. provides to comply with SEC registration as an Internet Investment Advisor.

### offzero.io
The technology company (not yet legally formed) Off-Zero Financial, LLC. uses for MyFi.Coach.
