The clock starts NOW...
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has granted Off-Zero Financial, LLC. registration according to Section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940!

## What does this mean?
I have 120 days to implement an interactive website that provides investment advice according to this [this exemption](https://www.sec.gov/rules/2002/12/exemption-certain-investment-advisers-operating-through-internet)

## Plan updates
To bring [The Plan](/plan.md) into reality, I've broken it up into 3 parts: 
1. Off-Zero Financial, LLC.
1. MyFi.Coach
1. offzero.io

### Off-Zero Financial, LLC. 
The Texas LLC formed to be registered as an Investment Advisor with the SEC under the Internet Investment Advisor exemption. This allows it to provide fiduciary investment advice to all US residents via an interactive website and removes the administrative burden to regiser with all 50 states to do so.

### MyFi.Coach
The interactive website Off-Zero Financial, LLC. provides clients to comply with the Internet Investment Advisors exemption for SEC registration under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.

### offzero.io
The technology company (not yet legally formed) Off-Zero Financial, LLC. uses to implement MyFi.Coach.
