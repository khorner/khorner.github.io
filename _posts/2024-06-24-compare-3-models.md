Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized the way we create content, offering diverse capabilities to generate human-like text. Today, I compare the output of three leading AI models—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—by asking them to write a brief LinkedIn recommendation for a former colleague. Here’s the original prompt and follow ups:

**Prompt 1:**
`Write a brief LinkedIn recommendation for a former colleague. He was the go-to specialist the team leaned on and was always cheerful to help. His strengths were technology, patience, teaching, and smiles.`

**Prompt 2:** 
`We worked together for about 4 years as Sales Engineers. His teaching of technology and sales process helped me transition into a top Solutions Engineer`

**Prompt 3:** 
`make it briefer`

### ChatGPT's Response
> I had the pleasure of working with [Colleague's Name] for about four years as Sales Engineers at [Company Name]. He was our go-to specialist, always cheerful and ready to help. His deep technological expertise and patient teaching style were instrumental in my transition to a top Solutions Engineer. [Colleague's Name] made complex concepts accessible and significantly impacted our team with his positive attitude and collaborative spirit. I highly recommend him for any role that values technical proficiency and mentorship.

### Gemini's Response
> For [Colleague's Name], who excelled as a Sales Engineer at [Previous Company]. His tech expertise was unmatched, but even more impressive was his patience and teaching skills. His clear explanations (and endless smiles!) were key to my own success transitioning to Solutions Engineer. Highly recommend!

### Claude's Response
> [Colleague's Name] was an invaluable colleague during our four years as Sales Engineers. His deep technical knowledge, patient teaching style, and cheerful demeanor made him our team's go-to specialist. [Colleague's Name]'s guidance in both technology and sales processes was crucial in my development into a top Solutions Engineer. His ability to elevate those around him while maintaining a positive attitude makes him an asset to any organization.

### Conclusion

In comparison, Claude dominates. This is supposed to be a personal recommendation that is compelling and Claude sounds like a natural response. The opening shows immediate impact and the last line seals the deal.

Gemini just sucks and ChatGPT is wordy. I specifically added
`"Responses to be clear, informative, and tailored to based on the context I provide. Make your tone or style of responses to be upbeat and semi-formal."`
to both and no modification to Claude.

ChatGPT generated the framework for this post and used a colon in the front-matter, causing an error. Perhaps that's where some responses are generated.
